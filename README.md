# Blessing-Fan-Form
Blessing's first interactive form - powered by Formspree  and custom styling.
This is a clean and simple web form built with HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT - with a splash of fun and personality!
Submissions are handled smoothly using Formspree.
## What It Does
- Let users submit info ina neat form
- Sends response directly to my e-mail using Formspree
- Displays a friendly message when submitted
- styled for both desktop and mobile screens
## Why I Made It
I'm currently learning web development and wanted to make something real - not just YouTube tutorial. 
This is one of my first interactive projects.
